# how to install / update

- GIT CLONE this repo
- download latest version of The Convergence with "Convergence ER Downloader.exe" (e.g. into your downloads folder)
- unzip ERR into the repo folder
- discard all changed and deleted files with GIT (if there are added files, the gitignore is outdated)
- unpack "Remove Erdtree.zip" into /mod (optional, considerable FPS boost)
- run Start_Convergence.bat

## large coop group ideas / toDos:

- duplicate enemy spawns
- nerf / remove shields (better block for melee, worse for ranged/caster)
- checking healing ranges again, maybe I missed some
- nerf healings
- flask amount?
- nerf stagger
- high dmg / low tankiness ememies
